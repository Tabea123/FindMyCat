    An implementation of a genetic algorithm. The input to the genetic algorithm 
    has several parts: a population of possible solutions to a task, an environment 
    in which the task is performed and a function that takes performs all possible 
    solutions and assigns to them a score that measures how well that solution 
    works on the task. The task in this package is to evolve the best strategy 
    to pick up elements in a two-dimensional grid.
