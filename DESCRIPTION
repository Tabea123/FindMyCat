Description: Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
    This package contains a genetic algorithm. The input to the genetic algorithm 
    has several parts: 
    a population of possible solutions to a task, an environment in which the task 
    is performed and a fitness function that takes a solution and assigns to it 
    a fitness value that measures how well that solution works on the task. 
    The task in this package is to evolve the best strategy to pick up elements 
    in a two-dimensional grid.
